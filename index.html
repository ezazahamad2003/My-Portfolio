        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Hi! I'm Ezaz Ahamad</h2>
        <img class="dp" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQF8_4-2BdoClQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1656307908749?e=1687996800&v=beta&t=TyNPVD313LRkOHlXlTTddtn5kh2rYJ40ohjCt3IlnZM" width="200px">
        <h3>Mechatronics:</h3>
        <p> I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering from California State University, CHICO. Currently, I work as a Battery Design Engineer at ODERO ENERGY SOLUTIONS LLP, where I calculate charge and current requirements for prototype batteries, design battery specifications and dimensions, and conduct battery testing and grading. I also assign motor specifications, including power, voltage, torque, and RPM, and develop the prototypes' built-in software.

            As a Design Engineer, I designed and developed an automated battery testing machine using Solidworks to create parts, assemblies, and CNC for extrusions. I also conducted part and assembly design using Solidworks, tolerance calculations, and GD&T, as well as manufacturing methods. In addition, I organized and led advanced manufacturing and robotics workshops, utilizing my skills in leadership, critical thinking, and teamwork.</p>
           
            <h3>Computer Science:</h3>
            <p>As a double major in Mechatronic Engineering and Computer Science at California State University, CHICO, I have a strong command of programming languages including C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized ladder logic programming language to develop software that interfaced with the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to control the machine's hardware and perform data analysis. In addition, I utilized Nvidia Jetson for a drone project and added speech-to-text ML to make it automated. With proficiency in Solidworks and CNC, I have designed and developed custom parts and assemblies, and integrated an automated battery testing machine into the production line to improve efficiency and reduce labor costs. My software skills include Blender and Solidworks, and I am also skilled in documenting the development process with detailed documentation and instructions for the operation and maintenance of the prototype.</p>
